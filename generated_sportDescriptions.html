<strong>Fall Sports</strong> (aka formatted wikipedia paragraphs for now)<br>
<hr />
<h3>3x3 Basketball</h3><br>
<strong>Rules and Requirements</strong>
<br>
Under the 2014 rules, the departures from regular full-court basketball are as follows:<p>

<p>Each team consists of three players and one substitute.<br />
The game is played on a half-court, with one basket.<br />
A size 6 basketball (circumference of 727–734 mm/28.5–29.0 in) is used for all divisions, including men's competitions. This is the standard size for women's basketball, and smaller than the size 7 standard (749–780 mm/29.5–30.7 in) used in the full-court men's game.<br />

<hr />
<h3>Sand Volleyball</h3><br>
<strong>Rules and Requirements</strong>
<br />Beach volleyball is fundamentally similar to indoor volleyball: a team scores points by grounding the ball on the opponents' court, or when the opposing team commits a fault (error or illegal action); consecutive contacts must be made by different players.
<p>
The major differences between beach and indoor volleyball are:
<p>
Playing surface – sand rather than hard court<br />
The dimensions of the court are 16 by 8 meters,compared to 18 by 9 meters in the indoor game.<br />
The beach court has no "attack line", unlike the indoor court, which has such a line 3 meters from the net.<br />

<hr />
<h3>Flag Football</h3><br>
<strong>Rules and Requirements</strong>
<br />

The specific rules of flag football vary widely by league, though all share in common their replication of the rules of traditional American football with tackling replaced by flag-pulling. Traditional American football rules are often omitted or simplified to reflect the more recreational nature of the game, desire to avoid physical contact and injury, and the generally smaller number of participating players per side.
<hr />
<h3>Outdoor Soccer</h3><br>
<strong>Rules and Requirements</strong>
<br />
Everyone has different opinions on this one.

<hr />
<h3>Volleyball</h3><br>
<strong>Rules and Requirements</strong>
<br />
Each team consists of six players. To get play started, a team is chosen to serve by coin toss. A player from the serving team throws the ball into the air and attempts to hit the ball so it passes over the net on a course such that it will land in the opposing team's court (the serve). The opposing team must use a combination of no more than three contacts with the volleyball to return the ball to the opponent's side of the net. These contacts usually consist first of the bump or pass so that the ball's trajectory is aimed towards the player designated as the setter; second of the set (usually an over-hand pass using wrists to push finger-tips at the ball) by the setter so that the ball's trajectory is aimed towards a spot where one of the players designated as an attacker can hit it, and third by the attacker who spikes (jumping, raising one arm above the head and hitting the ball so it will move quickly down to the ground on the opponent's court) to return the ball over the net. The team with possession of the ball that is trying to attack the ball as described is said to be on offense.
<hr />
<h3>Wiffle Ball</h3><p>
<strong>Rules and Requirements</strong>
<br />

In April 2011, the government of New York State proclaimed that Wiffle ball (as well as kickball, freeze tag, and dodgeball) was "unsafe" and a "significant risk of injury" for children, and declared that any summer camp program that included two or more of such activities would be subject to government regulation. The story often became a source of ridicule and amusement, with Parenting.com sarcastically commenting "According to new legislation introduced in New York State, to survive classic schoolyard games like capture the flag is to cheat death."Wiffle ball executives originally thought the order was a "joke". The company has never been sued over safety issues in its 50+ year history. The disapproval of people from across the nation pressured the NY legislature to remove Wiffle ball and many other entries from the list of high risk activities, such as archery and scuba diving, that require state government oversight.

<strong>Spring Sports</strong><br><hr />
<h3>Basketball</h3><br>
<strong>Rules and Requirements</strong>
<br />
An attempt to unfairly disadvantage an opponent through physical contact is illegal and is called a foul. These are most commonly committed by defensive players; however, they can be committed by offensive players as well. Players who are fouled either receive the ball to pass inbounds again, or receive one or more free throws if they are fouled in the act of shooting, depending on whether the shot was successful. One point is awarded for making a free throw, which is attempted from a line 15 feet (4.6 m) from the basket.
<p>
The referee may use discretion in calling fouls (for example, by considering whether an unfair advantage was gained), sometimes making fouls controversial calls or no-calls. The calling of fouls can vary between games, leagues and even among referees.
<br />


<hr />
<h3>Indoor Soccer</h3><br>
<strong>Rules and Requirements</strong>
<br />
Indoor soccer is one of several distinct variants of the game of football designed for play in indoor arenas. Indoor soccer is most popular in the United States, Canada and Mexico, with several amateur, collegiate and professional leagues functioning. It is also played in Brazil, where it is called showbol. Other variants of indoor football, such as futsal and five-a-side football, are more popular outside North America. These variants have different rules and governing bodies from those of indoor soccer.

<hr />
<h3>Softball</h3><br>
<strong>Rules and Requirements</strong>
<br />
Despite the name, the ball used in softball is not very soft. It is about 12 in. (30.5 cm) in circumference (11 or 12 in. for slow-pitch), which is 3 in. (8 cm) larger than a baseball. The infield in softball is smaller than on a baseball diamond; each base is 60 ft (18 m) from the next, as opposed to baseball's 90 ft. (27 m).

<hr />

<h3>Ultimate Frisbee</h3><br>
<strong>Rules and Requirements</strong>
<br />
Students Joel Silver and Jared Kass, along with Jonny Hines and Buzzy Hellring, invented ultimate frisbee in 1967 at Columbia High School, Maplewood, New Jersey, USA (CHS). The first game was played at CHS in 1968 between the student council and the student newspaper staff. Beginning the following year evening games were played in the glow of mercury-vapor lights on the school's parking lot. Initially players of ultimate frisbee (as it was known at the time) used a "Master" disc marketed by Wham-O, based on Fred Morrison's inspired "Pluto Platter" design. Hellring, Silver, and Hines developed the first and second edition of "Rules of Ultimate Frisbee". In 1970 CHS defeated Milburn High 43-10 in the first interscholastic ultimate game. CHS, Milburn, and three other New Jersey high schools made up the first conference of Ultimate teams beginning in 1971.
